Early code written while learning to code. Done during high school from around 2011. Cringe-worthy quality and some classy comments

greenwhite.rb - a lost cause. It let us plan patterns to display with our blazers while supporting our sports teams. The final version is sadly no-where to be found, but it worked surprisingly well.

Space Invaders: Needs shoes to run. Man, I loved that GUI toolkit, and I'm very happy to see it's up an being maintained. The game itself is fairly generic, but I was learning the idea of object oriented programming. Still hadn't quite got the hang of comments, and I love the way that my function names include punctuation for things like explode! or is_killed_by_ship?

Ruby was my first love (although I dabbled with JavaScript before that). Why_the_lucky_stiff's book was amazing, and it totally transformed the way I thought about programming (and the world). 

Collide: A really fun game! I got quite addicted to it, spending hours trying to beat my high score. May be pirating that background music but I don't think anyone else has played the game so who cares :P
